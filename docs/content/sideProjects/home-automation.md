I've recently used an old Surface to host a HomeAssistant VM so I can aggregate all my IoT devices through a single aggregated layer.

Things I've had fun learning:
* Setting up Linux on a Surface Pro
* Setting up networking between the host and guest VMs, as well as USB passthrough
* Migrating HomeAssistant's SQLite database to MariaDB
* Automating my lights for efficiency and storage heaters using temperature data from Zigbee sensors
* Visualising my SMETS2 data alongside Octopus API electricity prices
