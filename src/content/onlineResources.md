Prior to finding my job at Aurora, I used my time to brush up on my front-end web development skills. With my interest in photography and design, this was the way I intended to get my "foot in the door" and land my first development role.

freeCodeCamp teaches modern, responsive web-design first, before introducing other frontend libraries to work with. It was useful to brush up on HTML/CSS best practise before introducing libraries like React and also gave some small project ideas to work on and solidify learning.

CodeFights teaches coding interview technique and computer science through algorithm challenges; hands-on problem solving exercises. Similar to solving a sudoku at the weekend.

I took a CodeCademy course mid-2017 to “Build Frontend Web Apps from Scratch”, along with the Mongo University courses to familiarise myself with a NoSQL language and the JSON/BSON document structure.
