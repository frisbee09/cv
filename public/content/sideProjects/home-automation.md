I've recently used an old Surface to host a HomeAssistant VM so I can run all my IoT devices through a single aggregated layer.

Things I've had fun learning:

- Setting up Linux on a Surface Pro
- Setting up networking between the host and guest VMs, as well as USB passthrough
- Migrating HomeAssistant's SQLite database to MariaDB
- Automating my lights for efficiency and storage heaters using temperature data from Zigbee sensors
- Logging disk space into HA through MQTT for monitoring
- Using Tailscale for secure remote access
