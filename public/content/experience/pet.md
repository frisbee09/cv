Teaching intensive Maths revision courses across the country. The flagship course at the time covered the two year Maths specification in one week. Each week was a new school with new students and the challenge was to get them quickly on board and keep them engaged.

The work was seasonal, and during quiet periods I worked to update and maintain our curriculum to keep in line with changing exam board specs. Here I began making use of my programming skills to automate distributing updates to our various slide packs we would send out to courses.
