- Designing, planning and "product owning" our "model inputs" project, allowing users to interact with model assumptions through a web-based application. This then formed one of the key parts of Origin.
- Revolutionising our UI delivery architecture, implementing micro-frontends through Webpack federated modules and utilising AWS Step Functions to automate the testing, build and release of our applications across our environments. This removed a bottleneck we were facing, allowing multiple UI deployments across our teams to occur in parallel.
- Designing and maintaining features across multiple MERN and SERN stack micro-services
- Leading UI design for 7 projects, including a total redesign of the platform that serves content to customers
- Taking a role in recruiting the next set of front end devs
